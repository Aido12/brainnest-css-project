        <h2>Learn about JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is
          one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
          CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
          webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major
          web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on
          users' devices.

          JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
          conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing,
          prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
          multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
          programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
          for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
          structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
